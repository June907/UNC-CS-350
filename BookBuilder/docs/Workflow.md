# Development Workflow

The software development workflow has several main tasks.  You should set 
up your computer so that each part of the task can be seen at once.
Arrange the windows on your computer so that you can edit, browse, and
deploy very quickly.


## Edit

You text editor or IDE (integrated development environment) should always
be showing.  This is your default view of your source code.


## Browse

If you are developing static HTML pages you can activate them directly in
the browser for local testing.  The fastest way to do this is by using 
Live Preview in Brackets or the corresponding mode in your IDE.

You can also double-click the file to open it in your default browser.  When
you display the page keep the browser window open and move it to the side.
As you make changes view the updates by refreshing the browser.

If you are running Django then you must start the development server in 
order to view the webpages.   Leave the server running while you edit your
content to see the changes automatically.


## Commit

Have a window open that will quickly let you view and commit your changes into
the Github repository.  Github Desktop is a great application for this.
