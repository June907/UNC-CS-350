### Milestone 1. Project Plan Complete


Role: Programmer - Code

Goal: Version control

* Setup Github account
* Setup Github Pages repository
* Decide how to publish your project docs
* User Guide for development workflow



## Book Builder - Version control

All code for Book Builder lives in git repos at Github. This includes the application 
source code, the documents for development, and the customer website used for marketing.
Github also houses all of the project management team documentation that was created during
the project development cycle: wiki, issues, project kanban, and instant messages.

Github is at the heart of every aspect of the Book Builder project.  If it is not at Github
then it does not truly exist.


### Setup Github account

Registering the Github account is documented at 
[Register Github Account](../docs/GithubAccount.md).
This is a one time activity for the project, but it is documented so that anyone else
can reproduce the result.

The Github account used for the master version of the project will be located in the 
"Mark-Seaman" Github account.   Other team members will be set up as "Collaborators" to make
changes to the Issues, Wiki, and Project documents.


### Setup Github Pages repository

Github Pages will provide an automatic website that can be viewed by the Book Builder 
end-users and potential customers.  Like all web apps Book Builder needs to have a website
for marketing and training.

The Book Builder client website will be built so that the automatic publishing of 
Github Pages will make it publicly available.  To avoid any additional setup we will be using
the existing Github Pages in the repo at "https://github.com/Mark-Seaman.github.io.git".  
A "BookBuilder" directory will be used to hold the documents.

The customer website will be located at 
[https://Mark-Seaman.github.io/BookBuilder](https://Mark-Seaman.github.io/BookBuilder).


### Decide how to publish your project docs

Documents are written for communication within the team and to keep the client updated.
The documents will be available directly through the Github repository.  This will limit
the document visibility to the same people that have permissions to the code repository.

The [Github Repo](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Mark-Seaman.github.io)
holds the 
[Book Builder Documents](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Mark-Seaman.github.io/blob/master/BookBuilder)

### User Guide for development workflow

A tutorial helps [developers setup](../docs/Index.md) an effective workflow.  Each developer should read and
apply this information to configure their own computer system.
