# CS 350 Student Projects

[CS 350 Documents](Index.md)


Each student in CS 350 will select one of the following applications.

Students will work in groups of four people.

Each application will be built in a series of seven project milestones. This will culminate by each 
team delivering a medium sized web application.


## Applications
