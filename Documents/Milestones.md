# Software Engineering Milestones 

Every project can be broken into a series of small development projects.
This prevents the fantasy thinking that destroys many software projects.
Each milestone represents a significant step in the development of the 
project and must be fully completed before proceeding to the next step.

The milestones require a similar level of engineering effort.  This
means that the overall effort of the project will be roughly linear and
you will avoid a panic at the end.

Each milestone will be graded as it is completed.  Individuals will be 
graded on their assigned role on that specific milestone.  This means that
you will be graded on seven specific deliverables throughout the course.

These milestones are patterned after the Shrinking World Project Template

Each team member will be assigned an engineering role for each milestone.
Your role on the project will rotate with each milestone.  This will give
you exposure to all the development roles and force you to work together
as a team.
